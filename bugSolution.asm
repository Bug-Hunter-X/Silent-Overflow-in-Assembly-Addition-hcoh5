This improved version checks the carry flag (`CF`) after the addition.  If `CF` is clear, no overflow occurred. If `CF` is set, it indicates an overflow and the code jumps to the overflow handling section.  This section might involve setting an error flag, triggering an exception, or employing alternative calculation methods to avoid incorrect results.
